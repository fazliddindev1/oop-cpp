- **In-Depth Explanations:** Detailed code with thorough comments and documentation.
- **Complex Topics:** Includes polymorphism, inheritance, templates, design patterns, and more.
- **Practical Applications:** Examples based on real-world scenarios to illustrate the concepts.

## Topics Covered

1. **Classes and Objects:** Advanced class design, encapsulation, and abstraction.
2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** Base and derived classes, virtual functions, dynamic binding.
3. **Operator Overloading:** Overloading operators for custom object behavior.
4. **Templates:** Function and class templates, template specialization.
5. **STL (Standard Template Library):** Using STL containers and algorithms with OOP.
6. **Design Patterns:** Implement common design patterns like Singleton, Observer, Factory, etc.
